# Hindi-Aesthetics-Corpus

This corpus consists of novels and short stories written in Hindi language.
We scraped novels and stories from http://hindisamay.com, an e-library maintained by Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwa Vidyalaya (translated to Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University), Wardha, http://premchand.co.in, a website dedicated to the popular novelist Premchand’s stories, and Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute’s Digital Library (http://borilib.com).
As a preprocessing step, we split the text into sentences, tokenized the sentences and deleted special characters, English tokens and Latin numbers.
