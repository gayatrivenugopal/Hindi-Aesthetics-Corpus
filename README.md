# Hindi-Aesthetics-Corpus

This corpus consists of novels and short stories written in Hindi language.
We scraped novels and stories from http://hindisamay.com, an e-library maintained by Mahatma Gandhi Antarrashtriya Hindi Vishwa Vidyalaya (translated to Mahatma Gandhi International Hindi University), Wardha, http://premchand.co.in, a website dedicated to the popular novelist Premchand’s stories, and Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute’s Digital Library (http://borilib.com).
As a preprocessing step, we split the text into sentences and deleted special characters, English tokens and Latin numbers.

Majority of the work is associated with authors whose native state is Uttar Pradesh, a state in northern India.

Another observation made in the metadata was that only 4.84% of the publications are authored by females. This number was 0 in the pre-independence era for this corpus. However, the number increased as the years passed, although it is incomparable with that of the male authors.
